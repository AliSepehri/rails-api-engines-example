## Modular Ruby on Rails Application

Create `models` engine with following command:
```
rails plugin new models --full --api --database=postgresql
```

*NOTE:* You need to change your current directory to `/models` to create a new model to have all of your model classes in `model` engin, otherwise your model will be created in different engins.
